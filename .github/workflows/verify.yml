# Note: Kani verification has been moved to a separate on-demand workflow
# (.github/workflows/kani-verify.yml) because the CBMC processes consume
# 9+ GB of memory and will OOM the GitHub Actions runners (~7 GB RAM).
#
# To run Kani verification:
# 1. Use the "Kani Verification (On-Demand)" workflow from the Actions tab
# 2. Or run locally: cargo kani --tests 2>&1 | tee kani_all.log

jobs:
  # Kani verification removed - see kani-verify.yml for on-demand workflow
